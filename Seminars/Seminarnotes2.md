##**Questions and Answers** </br>

*1. Read up on the Boston Matrix* </br>

Boston Matrix or product portfolio matrix is a portfolio management tool that help businesses in identifying and prioritizing their product portfolios which aid in a business decision to allocate resources effectively.
The matrix classifies products in two dimension, market share and market growth. Market share is calculated in reference to competitors in the market, while market growth is the extent of an industry attractiveness.
Therefore, business products are classified into four different categories:
 1. Cash cows: High market share and slow market growth rate, generate a lot of cash and doesn’t require a lot of assets
 2. Dogs: low market share and slow market growth rate, break even
 3. Question marks: low market share and high market growth rate, generate a low amount of cash and require a lot of assets
 4. Stars: high market share and high market growth rate generate a lot cash and require a lot of assets. </br>
 
*2. How do you connect your requirements to your architecture?* </br>

Architecture is the fundamental structure of a software while requirements is the description of a software to be developed. Starting with one or the other introduces restraints to the system, therefore developing both concurrently addresses these drawbacks and many more [1]. </br>

*3. Can you connect all requirements directly? What do you do if you cannot?

Not all requirements can be connected to the architecture, because requirements come at different abstraction levels, have different amount of details and different clarity levels, therefore to connect requirements to architecture we need to remove abstractions from requirements and add details to make it viable to be connected to architecture [2, 1]. </br>
Although, some claim that architectural design decision and architecturally significant requirements are the same [2]. </br>
