1. What is large scale requirements engineering?
 Large scale requirement engineering refer to requiremnts engineering for large and complex systems e.g large industrial projects and where managing a complete set of interdependencies is practically unfeasible, but feasible among small bundles of requirements. Although, in some case the requiremnts number is so large that managing complete set of interdependencies among small bundles of requirements become unfeasible in practice.
 
2. What are the challenges in large scale requirements engineering?
 1. **Large number of requirements:** The larger the number of requiremnts the more complicated and difficult it will be to analyze, specify and manage.
 2. **Communication between teams problems:** Since the project require a lot of resources, the number of developers or teams could have adverse effect on communication and collaberation espicially if those teams are distributed.
 3. **Long implementaion time:** The time it takes to develop these project in some cases are so long that technology could change and public interest could shift.
 4. **Management of customer expectation:** Since projects with large-scale requirements are usually so large and complex it will be difficult to manage the customer expectation and communication the project progress to them.
 5. **Limited communication and face time with the customer:** Since the number of requirements is so large, eliciting all the requirements from the customers direcly will require a lot of time and effort.
 
3. What is the order of magnitude of the number of requirements we are discussing?  <br/> 
 The sources vary on the number of requirements to be considered large scale, although it does not only depend on the number of requirements it also depends on thier complexity and size of features they describe additionially, the system being developed is also a factor.

##**Paper Summaries**

#*Paper 1*

A release plan involves all the decisions related to the selection of features for each release to meet the important technical, risk, resource and budget constraint. Therefore, release planning is a very important and integral part of software projects and poor release planning could lead to unsatified customers, faliures to deliver on the project and poor bussiness value. 
<br/>
The objective of this paper is to describe the art and science of software release planning. According to aurhor, the art of release planning relies on the human element i.e his intuition and capabilities to make the best decisions between conflicting objectives and constraints, while the science of release planning refer the methodologies and systems that yeild best results for release planning.
<br/>
There are many challenges involved with release planning, but it mainly relate the cognitive and computational complexity of it.
To solve these challenges the paper offer two approaches:
* The first one relies on the human factor it is the art of release planning.
* The second one relies on more systematic and repeateable methodologies that is backed by meaningful data.
<br/>
<br/>
The authors further explain that the art and science of release planning while they both have challenges and justifications, they do not conradict but complement each other. To create synergy between them the author proposes a hybrid release planning framework, that is consisted of three phases:
1. Modeling the detail of the problem: which has three frameworks and they are, planning objectives, resource allocation and stakeholder voting.
2.	Exploration where an actual solution to the formal modeled problem is extracted.
3.	Consolidation where the solutions are analyzed and modified (Scenario-playing and Re-Estimation).
