#**Questions and Answers**
*1. What is GAP analysis?* </br>

GAP analysis is the measure of postive and negative "gaps" between what the customer expect and what the customer recieve/product offers.[1]

*2. What is CVA analysis?* </br>

Customer Value Analysis is measuring the same variable as the GAP analysis but adding a competitor products to the process, and the analysed product is judged upon it's shortcomings in comparison to said competitor products.[1]

*3. What is IVA analysis?* </br>

Internal Value Analaysis is the measure weather a product is in line with a company's other products or strategies while resource limitation and the company other products in mind.[1]

*4. What tools are available for Continuous Integration?* </br>

Jenkins-ci, Codeship, Apache Continuum etc.
  * Experience:  </br>
  I used jenkins-ci before on a project. I created a maven project and used subversion as a code management tool, we used eclipse as an IDE and the code was written in java. Jenkins-ci would give daily builds and reports, and we felt that it hindered our work because we had to deal with on a regular bases and we felt it just added to our workload, most conflicts Jenkins falgged could easily be fixed using subversion alone code merging tool. We came to the conclusion that it did not work in our case because: 
  (1)the number of contributors was too few and we communicated face to face daily, therefore we could solve most code conflict without Jenkins.
  (2)Our inexperience with it as a tool and continous integration as a concept e.g. some contributors had not heard of continuous integration before we started the work. 
  
*5. What is technical product management?*</br>

*6. What is roadmapping? How can you do it in large scale?*</br>

Roadmapping is creating a strategy or a long term plan for a project, it provides an overview of the evolving market, competing products and technologies over time[2]. Additionially in software engineering, it provide a high level view of the products and links requirement engineering to the bussiness aspect. A typical roadmap involves the different stakeholders of the project, making decisions, which when followed, the roadmap outcome is reached[3]. For large scale roadmapping to be effective, it must solves large scale project issues[4].
